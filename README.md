# Virtual Communication Tracker Project

The project is a communication dissemention system designed for employees to access neccessary trainings. All users access the site through a secure login. SQL database is used to store necessary information. Those with admin priviledges can post, edit, and view the trainings required for all employees. Once trainings are completed there is a sign off feature notifying both the user and employer that the trainings have been completed. The backend is developed with PHP and Javascript. The frontend is developed with HTML and CSS. 

### Prerequisites

- Must have a SQL database and database server. Add the credentials on the db_credentials.php file
- Must have [Microsoft Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/active-directory-domain-services-overview) for secure login. 
- Download Microsoft SQL [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms)

### Using the Script

- Configure the HTML and CSS to generate your desired site visual
- Change the attributes in the classes to fit the database. A class is defined for each table in the database
- Run the script on the server
